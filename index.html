    <div>Currently pursuing learning at 'Columbia University' as a graduate student.My Concentration lies in Virtual/Augmented Reality(VR/AR), Blockchain(ZK, Smartcontract, Web3, EVM, solidity, rust), Artificial Intelligence(ML,DL,RL agent), Graphics/Animation, UI/UX Design, Robotics, 5G/4G/IoT and Vision. I am determined and committed to improving myself in these domains to achieve the expertise.I am passionate to develop Intelligent Systems, (VR/AR/UI/Smartcontract) Applications, and Robots for a better future.I have social awareness and I am more focused to join teams that have strong motivation to make the world better.I can also team up with Physicists, Environmentalists, Climate Activists, Geographers to create an impact in everyday lives by creating suitable systems and applications. I believe my interests and career lies in AR, VR, Artificial Intelligence, UI/UX/HCI, and BlockChain communities</div>
    <br/>
    <div>Recently, I designed a 3D game In unity (has about 5000 lines of code) (similar to GTA V) called "Explorer on Roll" under the supervision of Prof. Stephen Fiener (Can take a look in my GitHub, <a href="https://youtu.be/U_c7eTyjilE"> Check Out</a>). I also designed a Mobile application named "Activity Recorder" using Android Studio. I also had experiences building Twitter pages using bootstrap, IMDB,.. I am active contributor to open source. Currently, I am working on a Smartcontract based (financial) startup - partnering with Olam ventures under the supervision of Mr. Phill Davies. Follow Me on LinkedIn to know more!!</div>  
    <br/>  
    <div>Apart from my professional background, my Research contributions in Computer Networks need to have a special mention. “Professor T.G Venkatesh <tgvenky@ee.iitm.ac.in>” and I developed a concept called “Medium Dense Cellular(MDC) Network” for a better business initiative for the 5G world. I also had one more research contribution in the area of Slotted ALOHA protocols in IoT. I am confident that I can contribute immensely to the team as a UI research intern with my skills. Furthermore, I had research contributions in the BlockChain world. I was awarded $1000(ETH) for being the Design(Research) Head for the team “Eclipse Defender” Last Summer.</div>
    <br/>
    <div>Heads-up, My Research proposal about a new framework-MDC network in the area of Physical Communications(Networks) is being reviewed by Springer and is on track to publish (Along with Prof. TG Venkatesh, IIT Madras)
        <br/>  <br/>
        Earlier, I completed my bachelor's at IIT Madras in Electrical Engineering, focused on Communications.I researched under Prof.TG Venkatesh in Computer Networks.I worked at Qualcomm for about 3 years, developing a new Snapdragon Processor for 5G gadgets as a MODEM 4G Downlink Multi/Single- Sim Systems Engineer.As a part of my work profile, I acquired immense knowledge on 3GPP System Specifications and the research within it.I had exposure to Firmware Module(4G) at Qualcomm.I also contributed as a Software Developer at 'Securifi Embedded Systems' deploying Cloud technologies.
        <br/><br/>
        Apart from my academic pursuits and professional experience, as a part of leisure, activity, i find comfort in watching movies, listening to Spiritual Gurus, and exploring new and exciting content (history,..)
        <br/><br/>
        To discuss further any opportunity, I will be available by phone (201)294-9901/ e-mail: "sv2665@columbia.edu"

      I am a Software Engineering Professional with more than 4 years of Experience in developing/engineering low latency RTOS-based systems in C/C++(involves multi-threaded software stack & Embedded devices) and also in building 3D AR/VR TCP/USB/UART/I2C/multimedia based networking UI in Unity C#(coroutines), C++, Python following design patterns (queuing, messaging) in Web2/Web3 for Bio-Medical Researchers - in vaious OS such as IoS, Android, MAC, Oculus. My passion in acquiring knowledge led me to complete a double masters in Columbia University(CS) & IIT Madras(EC). My top Skills lie in Operating Systems(OS), 5G/4G/IoT Networks, Distributed Systems, Artificial Intelligence(ML,DL,RL agent), AR/VR/Graphics, UI/UX, Blockchain(ZK, Concurrency, EVM, solidity, Rust). I am determined, committed and passionate to develop Embedded/Distributed, Intelligent Systems, VR/AR/UI Apps, for a better future. I have social awareness and I am more focused to join strong system oriented teams to make the world better.I can team up with Tech, Automotive, Medical, Physicists, Climate teams to create an impact in everyday lives by creating suitable systems and applications.

      Background:<br/>
Before joining industry in 2018, I completed my bachelor's at IIT Madras in Electrical Engineering, focused on Communication Systems.I researched under Prof.TG Venkatesh in Computer Networks. Later, I was fortunate to develop RTOS based system for 5G modem in SnapDragon in it's hay days - as a Software Engineer at Qualcomm. I acquired immense knowledge on RTOS platforms, 3GPP System Specifications, Embedded Systems and developed a productive Work-ethic. I also worked as a Cloud Engineer at 'Securifi Embedded Systems' deploying Cloud technologies for quite some time.
<br/>
      Currently, I am developing 3D/2D multimedia based networking games alongside embedded system engineers for Bio-Medical Researchers and Prof. Joshua Jacobs. I developed multiple 3D games involving AR/VR in Oculus Headset. Games include - Schezuan (VR cooking game), Maze Traversal (ARCore), Treasure Hunt (ARKit), Explorer-On-Roll (~ Temple Run). I developed a Mobile application "Activity Recorder" in Kotlin. I had experiences building Twitter/IMDB pages using bootstrap. I am active contributor to open source. I am also an active hustler and working on building an AI based B2B platform - partnering with Olam ventures under the supervision of Mr. Phill Davies.
